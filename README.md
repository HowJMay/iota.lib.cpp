## Introduction

This is not (yet) an official C++ client library for the [IOTA Reference Implementation (IRI)](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri).

It implements both the [official API](https://iota.readme.io/docs/getting-started), as well as [newly proposed features](https://github.com/iotaledger/wiki/blob/master/api-proposal.md#proposed-api-calls).

## Warning

This is an early beta release, expect unexpected results.

There may be performance and stability issues.

This library is still in early development and there may be breaking changes in the near future.
